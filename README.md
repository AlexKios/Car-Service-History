# Vehicle Service History

## Overview  
**Vehicle Service History** is a lightweight, cross-platform mobile app built with Xamarin and SQLite that helps car owners track and plan routine maintenance. Whether you own one car or a fleet, it keeps a clear, chronological log of every oil change, tyre swap, repair or inspection—and reminds you when it’s due.

## Features

- **Multiple Vehicles**  
  - Add, edit or remove any number of cars  
  - Store make, model, year, engine type, tyre type, current mileage, last-oil-change mileage & date  

- **Detailed Service Logs**  
  - For each car, record unlimited “notes” with date, odometer reading & description  
  - Browse entries one-by-one or view all notes in a scrollable list  

- **Automated Reminders**  
  - Oil–change notifications based on either:  
    - Mileage (every +5 000 km beyond the last change)  
    - Time (every 9 months since last change)  
  - Tyre-swap reminders on fixed calendar dates (spring & autumn) if non “all-season” tyres are fitted  

- **Simple, Intuitive UI**  
  - Native Android Activities with XML layouts  
  - Navigation drawer & menu for quick access: Home, Notes, Add Car  

- **Offline-first Storage**  
  - Local SQLite database:  
    - **Cars** table for vehicle records  
    - One **Notes** database per car for its maintenance entries

## Technologies & Plugins

- **Xamarin.Android** (C#)  
- **SQLite-net** for local data persistence  
- **Plugin.LocalNotification** for cross-platform local reminders  
- **Xamarin.Essentials** for platform utilities

## Architecture

1. **MainActivity**  
   - Displays selected car’s summary  
   - OnStop() schedules notifications for all cars  
   - Drawer menu → Home / All Notes / Add Car

2. **Add_Car / Update_Car Activities**  
   - Form validation for tyres (“winter”/“summer”/“all season”) and required fields  
   - Inserts/updates `Car` object into `Cars` table  
   - Creates a new `AllNotes` database file for the car

3. **Show_More_Info Activity**  
   - Loads the selected car’s `AllNotes` SQLiteConnection  
   - Cycles through notes with “Previous”/“Next” buttons or shows all in a ScrollView list  
   - Supports add, edit & delete of individual `Note` entries

4. **Choose_Car Activity**  
   - Lists all cars in a TableLayout  
   - “Select” button tags each row to set the `currentCarId`

## Data Model

```csharp
// Cars table
public class Car {
  [PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement] public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Model { get; set; }
  public string Year { get; set; }
  public string Engine { get; set; }
  public string Tyre { get; set; }
  public string Km { get; set; }           // Current odometer
  public string KmOfOil { get; set; }      // Odometer at last oil change
  public string DateOfOil { get; set; }    // Date of last oil change
}

// Notes table (one file per car)
public class Note {
  [PrimaryKey, AutoIncrement] public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Date { get; set; }
  public string Km { get; set; }
  public string Text { get; set; }
}
```
